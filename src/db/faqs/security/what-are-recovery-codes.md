## What are Recovery Codes?

A Recovery Code is an alphanumeric string of characters which proves that you are authorized to access your account. When you sign up, we provide you with a set of Recovery Codes.

In the case that you forget your password or MPIN, we require you to enter one of the Recovery Codes to complete your account recovery. If you lose your Recovery Codes, you may contact Help & Support at [support@eplayment.com](mailto:support@eplayment.com?)
